# soundnet
Like icecast but with a visual frontend backed by the snake's language. (Python)
I developed this for Windows ffmpeg, so using it on linux requires some modification.
You have to modify the code to select the microphone. Keep FFMPEG next to the python,
otherwise it will break. No flask or anything. No extra dependencies.
